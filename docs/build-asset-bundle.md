![Delete pre made assets](./img/build-asset-bundle-2.png)

2. Delete all pre made asset files except `Settings`.

![Import assets](./img/build-asset-bundle-3.png)

1. Create directory you want to pack assets, and import assets to your directory.

I'd recommend to separate them by each customization types for organization purposes.
- `accessories`
- `eyes`
- `mouths`
- `hats`

### Important!

Asset bundle only can have lower cases so you should use `snake_case` convention for these assets.

4. Setup imported assets for each customization types.  
   You should change import settings of your assets.  
   Click asset will make inspector shows it's import settings.
   - Accessory, Mouth
     - Check 'Alpha is Transparency'
     - Uncheck 'Generate Mipmap' in 'Advanced' foldout

     - Uncheck 'Alpha is Transparency'
     - Uncheck 'Generate Mipmap' in 'Advanced' foldout
     - Set Wrap Mode to 'Clamp'

   - Hat
     - For model(fbx)
       - In 'Model' tab, check 'Bake Axis Conversion'
     - For textures

For model, you should check imported prefab's transform.

You can find it easily by scroll down of model import settings.

It should has default transform values. (All zero, one scale)
